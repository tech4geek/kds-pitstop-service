        <h3 id="personal-information-you-disclose-to-us">Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em></p>

        <p>However the data used to display and operate in the application ('Application Data') is stored only on your
            device through local file storage and required to operate application optimally, we don't store or backup
            your application data files on our servers or store in any form at our end. If you wish to wipe such data

            reporting purposes.</p>
        <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us

        <p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our
                Services, including:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</strong> We may process your
                information to provide you with the requested service.</li>
            <li><strong>To evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing, and your experience.</strong> We may
                process your information when we believe it is necessary to identify usage trends, determine the
                effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Services, products,
                marketing, and your experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="when-and-with-whom-do-we-share-your-personal-information">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR
            PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this
                section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
        <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or
                during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
                portion of our business to another company.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
                purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
            or other legal requirements).</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
            from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
            protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
            secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
            within a secure environment.</p>
        <h2 id="do-we-collect-information-from-minors">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18
                years of age.</em></p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
            represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
            such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
            years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
            delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a
                href="#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>'
            below.</p>
        <h2 id="what-are-your-privacy-rights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
            information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right

            the contact details provided in the section '<a href="#how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice">HOW CAN
                YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
            when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
            on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <h2 id="controls-for-do-not-track-features">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
            a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <h2 id="do-we-make-updates-to-this-notice">9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant
                laws.</em></p>
        <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
            'Last updated' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
            material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
            changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
            to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
